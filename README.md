# push_swap

A program in the C Programming Language that will sort out any random collection of integers in ascending order, using a data-sorting algorithm called 'Radix Sort'. 
The process of sorting the collection of integers has to take place by utilizing two stacks and a number of ‘operations’ that can be used to move the data on the stacks.
The output of the program will be a set of operation codes that when executed on the stacks, sorts the collection of integers.
